# Finchcord
*Based on Stossycord*

Finchcord is a Discord Client Native to iOS Devices. It is made in 100% Swift and SwiftUI for Privacy, Responsiveness and Security

**Note:** Finchcord is still in beta so there will be bugs and glitches, if you find any please make an issue

- Mac macOS 13+
- A Discord Account (Token is needed, this will change sometime in the future)

## Not Supported Features (Coming Soon)

## Why?
I made this fork to add some features and to more activly maintain the concept that Stossycord had. This also gives me a reason to learn Swift, so some features may be unpolished.
